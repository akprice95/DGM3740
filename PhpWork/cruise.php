				<h2>Space Station travelfrom $2999</h2>
				<p>The station will consist of a 190-metre-diameter wheel that will rotate to create a gravitational force similar to that felt on the moon. Around the wheel will 
                    be 24 individual modules fitted out with sleeping accommodation and other support functions. There will also be many of the things you see on cruise ships: restaurants, 
                    bars, musical concerts, movie screenings, and educational seminars. Some modules will be sold as private residences, while others will be rented to 
                    governments for scientific purposes. In total the Gateway Foundation expect the population of the station to be around 400.</p>
